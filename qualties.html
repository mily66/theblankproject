  <p>When you're interviewing for a job,
     you know you need to sell the hiring manager on why your background,
     kills and industry experience are a match for the position.
     But there's one crucial piece of the puzzle that you shouldn't overlook:
     Is your personality right for the job?
     No two people are identical; certain personality traits can make people
     similar or dissimilar to others. The importance of different personalitie
     in the workplace can be traced to several different factors. A team made
     up of several different compatible personalities that complement one another
     can be more productive than a team made up of those who are so similar they
     cannot work productively together.
