    <h1>Resume<h1>
      <p> A resume is a brief written summary of a job applicant’s past employment history,
         education, and other pertinent information. The term resume is used primarily in America,
         where it has taken the place of the Latin expression curriculum vitae, or CV. A resume is the only
         chance you get to showcase yourself.<p>

      <h1>Cover Letter<h1>
        <p>The cover letter allows you to target the job and the employer in a very specific way,
          leaving the resume to market your skills, qualities and experience as a part of the bigger picture.
          Your resume then needs less tweaking with each application because the letter, which must be different each time, does that for you.<p>

              <p>Too many candidates mistakenly believe that being called in for an interview is being guaranteed a position.
                 Nothing could be further from the truth. You might be the last person on a short list of candidates.
                  Your skills, knowledge, and abilities are good – but not a perfect match for the company. However,
                the hiring manager is interested enough to meet with you and allow you to sell yourself to the company.<p>

                      Nothing worse for a hiring manager than to interview someone who hasn’t a clue what their company produces.
